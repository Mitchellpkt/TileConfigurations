Combinatorial puzzle

Exploring this question, posed by a friend:

* What I'm ultimately trying to figure out has two parts*

*Part 1: find the number of unique ways to shade m squares of an n x n grid for all m < or = n^2*

*There should be two cases for this part, one case for where n is even and another where its odd.*

*Part 2*
*Calculate the sum from m=1 to m= n^2 of the function created in part 1.`*`

To do: pivot from numerical study to analytical solution.
